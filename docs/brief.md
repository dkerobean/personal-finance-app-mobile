# Project Brief: Personal Finance App

## Executive Summary (v2)
This project is a personal finance management application for Android and iOS, built with React Native. The app aims to provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools to track their income, expenses, and investments, calculate their net worth, and set savings goals. Key features will include integration with mobile money and bank accounts for automated data syncing, AI-powered financial insights, and push notifications for important alerts. The backend will be built on a cost-effective and scalable serverless architecture to ensure security and data persistence. The project will eventually be monetized through a subscription model for premium features.

## Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle to get a clear, consolidated view of their financial health, leading to financial stress and missed opportunities. They often use multiple, disconnected platforms to manage their moneyâ€”separate bank apps, mobile money services, investment portfolios, and manual spreadsheets for budgeting. This fragmentation results in a lack of visibility, manual effort, and ineffective planning, particularly because many global apps lack deep integration with local financial systems like Mobile Money in Ghana.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a unified, intelligent personal finance mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native. It will serve as a single dashboard for a user's entire financial life by securely connecting to their bank and Mobile Money accounts. Its key differentiators are its hyper-local focus on the Ghanaian financial ecosystem, AI-powered insights that offer personalized advice, and its all-in-one consolidation of a user's financial data.

## Target Users
The primary user segment is the "Ambitious Millennial/Gen Z Professional" aged 22-35 in urban Ghana. They are tech-savvy, use digital finance tools, and need a simple, automated way to manage their money and work towards their financial goals.

## Goals & Success Metrics
**Business Objectives:** Validate the MVP, acquire the first 1,000 users, and test a 2% conversion to a premium subscription post-MVP.

**User Success:** Users achieve financial clarity by actively using the app, make progress on savings goals, and report making better financial decisions.

**KPIs:** Monthly Active Users (MAU), user retention rates, feature adoption, app store ratings (>4.5), and crash-free sessions (>99%).

## MVP Scope
**Core Features:** Secure user auth, manual transaction entry, connecting to at least one bank and one Mobile Money provider, transaction categorization, a simple dashboard, basic reports, and basic alerts.

**Out of Scope for MVP:** AI-powered insights, full investment tracking, a detailed net worth calculator, advanced savings goals, and the subscription paywall.

## Post-MVP Vision
After the MVP, the product will evolve by adding the "out of scope" features like AI insights and a net worth calculator. The long-term vision includes integrating with investment platforms and adding credit score monitoring, with potential expansion into small business finance and other African markets.

## Technical Considerations (v2)
**Frontend:** React Native with the Expo framework.

**Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL DB, Auth, Edge Functions).

**Repositories:** A Polyrepo structure on GitHub (separate frontend and backend repos).

**Integrations:** A financial data aggregator like Mono for bank/MoMo connections, and a service like OneSignal for push notifications.

## Constraints & Assumptions
**Constraints:** The project has a minimal budget, relying on free-tier services. It will be developed by a single person.

**Assumptions:** We assume a reliable financial data aggregator API for Ghana is available and affordable, and that users will consent to linking their accounts.

## Risks & Open Questions
**Risks:** Technical complexity of API integration, gaining user trust with financial data, and dependency on third-party services.

**Open Questions:** Which specific banks/MoMo services are essential for launch? What is the detailed data security strategy? What is the user support and initial marketing plan?
