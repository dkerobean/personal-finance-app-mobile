# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be notified when I'm about to go over my budget,
**so that** I can adjust my spending in time.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. A push notification is sent when a user's spending in a budgeted category reaches 90% of its limit.
2. A different push notification is sent when a user's spending exceeds 100% of the budget.
3. Users can enable or disable these budget alerts in the app's settings.
4. Alerts are triggered promptly after a transaction that crosses the threshold is recorded.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds on Stories 3.1 and 3.2:
- Requires budget creation and management (3.1) to have budgets to monitor
- Uses budget tracking calculations (3.2) to determine when thresholds are crossed
- Integrates with Epic 1 transaction system where alerts are triggered

## Data Models
Alert settings model for user preferences:
```typescript
export interface AlertSettings {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  budget_alerts_enabled: boolean;
  warning_threshold: number; // Default 90
  over_budget_alerts_enabled: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

Alert history for tracking sent notifications:
```typescript
export interface AlertHistory {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  budget_id: string;
  alert_type: 'warning' | 'over_budget';
  sent_at: string;
  notification_id: string; // OneSignal notification ID
  status: 'sent' | 'failed' | 'pending';
}
```

## External API Integration
OneSignal push notification integration: [Source: architecture.md#External APIs → OneSignal API]
- Documentation: https://documentation.onesignal.com/
- Backend authentication: App ID and REST API Key
- POST /notifications endpoint for sending alerts
- Player ID management for targeting specific users
- Notification templates with dynamic content

## API Specifications
Alert management endpoints:
- GET /settings/alerts: Retrieve user's alert preferences
- PUT /settings/alerts: Update alert preferences (enable/disable)
- POST /alerts/test: Send test notification to verify setup
- Internal: POST /alerts/process: Triggered by transaction changes
- All endpoints require JWT authentication [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]

## Component Specifications
Alert-related UI components: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **NotificationSettingsScreen**: Main alert configuration interface
- **AlertToggle**: Reusable toggle component for different alert types
- **TestNotificationButton**: Allows users to test notification setup
- **AlertStatusCard**: Shows recent alert activity and status

## File Locations
Frontend alert management: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- New: `app/(app)/settings/notifications.tsx` (alert settings screen)
- New: `src/components/settings/NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx`
- New: `src/components/alerts/AlertToggle.tsx`
- New: `src/services/alertService.ts`
- Update: Transaction services to integrate alert checking

Backend alert system: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- New: `supabase/functions/budget-alerts/`
- New: `supabase/functions/shared/notification-service.ts`
- Update: Transaction CRUD functions to trigger alert processing
- New: `supabase/migrations/create_alert_tables.sql`

## Security Requirements
Alert system security: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- All alert settings protected by RLS policies [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- JWT authentication for all alert management endpoints [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]
- Validate user permissions before sending notifications
- Secure OneSignal API key storage and usage [Source: architecture.md#Development Workflow → Environment Configuration]

## State Management
Alert settings integration: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
interface AlertStore {
  alertSettings: AlertSettings | null;
  loading: boolean;
  
  // Actions
  fetchAlertSettings: () => Promise<void>;
  updateAlertSettings: (settings: Partial<AlertSettings>) => Promise<void>;
  sendTestNotification: () => Promise<void>;
  
  // Selectors
  areAlertsEnabled: () => boolean;
  getWarningThreshold: () => number;
}
```

## Business Logic
Alert triggering logic:
- Calculate budget percentage: (currentSpent / budgetAmount) * 100
- Trigger warning at 90% threshold (configurable)
- Trigger over-budget alert at 100% threshold
- Prevent duplicate alerts within same budget period
- Handle edge cases: budget changes, transaction deletions, category changes

## Performance Considerations
Alert processing optimization:
- Efficient budget calculation queries with proper indexing
- Asynchronous alert processing to avoid blocking transaction operations
- Alert queuing system for reliable delivery
- Batch processing for multiple threshold crossings
- Cache recent alert history to prevent duplicates

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive alert system testing: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Threshold detection accuracy testing
- Notification delivery testing (with OneSignal mocking)
- Settings persistence and retrieval testing
- Edge case testing: concurrent transactions, budget changes
- Performance testing: Alert processing under load

## Technical Constraints
Notification system requirements:
- Support iOS and Android push notifications
- Handle notification permissions gracefully
- Provide fallback for users who disable notifications
- Maintain alert history for debugging and user reference
- Ensure alerts are timely and relevant (not delayed or outdated)
