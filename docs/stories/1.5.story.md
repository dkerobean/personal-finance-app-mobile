# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a simple dashboard with a summary of my finances,
**so that** I can understand my current situation at a glance.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. The dashboard is the first screen visible after a user logs in.
2. The dashboard displays a "Total Balance" card, calculated from all manual income and expense transactions.
3. The dashboard displays a list of the five most recent transactions.
4. The dashboard data updates automatically and correctly after a transaction is added, edited, or deleted.

# Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Route and Layout (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set `app/(app)/index.tsx` as dashboard; ensure auth guard routes here post-login [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Routing Architecture`]

- [x] Total Balance Card (AC: 2)
  - [x] Compute total balance = sum(income amounts) − sum(expense amounts) from transactions store [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture`]
  - [x] Create `components/dashboard/TotalBalanceCard.tsx` using React Native components

- [x] Recent Transactions (AC: 3)
  - [x] Query latest 5 transactions (by date desc) and render list `components/dashboard/RecentTransactions.tsx`
  - [x] Tap navigates to transaction detail

- [x] Data Reactivity (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subscribe to transactionStore changes; recompute total and list when store updates [Source: `docs/architecture.md#State Management Architecture`]
  - [x] After create/edit/delete (Story 1.4), ensure store refresh triggers UI update

- [x] Services and State
  - [x] Provide `transactionStore` selectors for totals and latest 5 [Source: `docs/architecture.md#State Management Architecture`]
  - [x] Ensure services layer fetch supports limit/sort [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Services Layer`]

- [x] Testing
  - [x] Unit tests: total balance computation for mixed income/expense [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Testing`]
  - [x] Component tests: renders 5 latest, updates on store changes [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy`]

# Dev Notes

## Data Models
- Transaction fields required: `amount`, `type`, `transaction_date` [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Data Models` → Transactions]

## API Specifications
- For recent list, backend list endpoint should support sorting/limiting; otherwise filter on client after fetch [Source: `docs/architecture.md#API Specification` → `/transactions`]

## Component Specifications
- Dashboard composed of Total Balance card and Recent Transactions list; navigates to details [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture`]

## File Locations
- Screen: `app/(app)/index.tsx`
- Components: `src/components/dashboard/TotalBalanceCard.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/RecentTransactions.tsx`
- Store/Services: reuse from Story 1.4 [Source: `docs/architecture.md#State Management Architecture`, `#Frontend Services Layer`]

## Testing Requirements
- Co-located tests; validate recalculation on store updates; stable rendering of latest 5 [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Testing`, `#Testing Strategy`]

## Technical Constraints
- TypeScript, React Native (Expo), Gluestack UI; responsive and smooth UX [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack`, `#Performance Optimization`]
