# Story

**As a** new user,
**I want** to create a secure and verified account with my email and password,
**so that** I can ensure my account is protected and start tracking my finances.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Initial React Native (Expo) and Supabase projects are set up and linked.
2. A registration screen exists with fields for email and a secure password.
3. User input is validated on the client-side (e.g., valid email format, password strength).
4. Upon submitting the form, a verification code is sent to the user's email address.
5. The user is prompted to enter the verification code to complete the registration.
6. Upon successful verification, a new user is created in the Supabase authentication system and marked as "verified".
7. The user is automatically logged in and redirected to the main dashboard screen.
8. Clear error messages are shown for failed registrations or incorrect verification codes.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
None (first story in Epic 1).

## Data Models
- Profile: Public user profile associated with `auth.users` [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Data Models` → Profiles]
- No application tables are created in this story; focus is authentication and session.

## API Specifications
- Supabase Auth is the authentication provider. Use `signUp()` to trigger email verification and `verifyOtp()` to confirm the user, then rely on Supabase session/JWT for auth [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Core Workflows` and `#Authentication Security`].
- Standardized error shape to be mirrored in the client error handling layer [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy`].

## Component Specifications
- Registration Screen (`app/(auth)/register.tsx`): email, password inputs; submit to `signUp()`; show success state and navigate to verification.
- Verification Screen (`app/(auth)/verify.tsx`): code input; submit to `verifyOtp()`; on success, persist session and route to dashboard.
- UI Library: Gluestack UI [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack`].

## File Locations
- Screens: expo-router groups `/(auth)` and `/(app)` per routing architecture [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Routing Architecture`].
- Services: `src/services/supabaseClient.ts` for Supabase client [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Services Layer`].
- State: `src/stores/authStore.ts` using Zustand [Source: `docs/architecture.md#State Management Architecture`].

## Testing Requirements
- Frontend unit/component testing with Jest + RNTL; tests co-located next to components [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Frontend Testing`].
- Follow testing pyramid; add integration tests for auth flow; optional Maestro E2E for registration happy path [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy`].

## Technical Constraints
- TypeScript across stack; React Native (Expo) target mobile only [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack`].
- Secure token storage via Expo Secure Store [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Authentication Security`].
- Aim for smooth UX with minimal perceived latency [Source: `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals-v2.md#Accessibility-Best-Practices`].

## Project Structure Notes
- Ensure the file/folder layout aligns with the Unified Project Structure guidelines for the mobile repo [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Unified Project Structure`].
