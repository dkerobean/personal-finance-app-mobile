# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see my automatically synced transactions alongside my manual entries,
**so that** I have a single, unified view of my finances.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Synced transactions appear in the main "All Transactions" list.
2. Synced transactions are clearly identifiable from manual entries (e.g., via a bank logo).
3. The dashboard's "Total Balance" and "Recent Transactions" widgets are updated to include data from synced accounts.
4. Users can change the category of a synced transaction but cannot edit the amount, date, or description.

# Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Transaction List Updates (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Modify TransactionsList component to display both manual and synced transactions [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]

  - [ ] Create SyncedTransactionBadge component using Gluestack UI Badge [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack → UI Component Library]
  - [ ] Show account_name for synced transactions vs "Manual" for user-entered
  - [ ] Use visual styling to distinguish synced vs manual (e.g., different background tint)

- [ ] Dashboard Integration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update TotalBalanceCard calculation to include synced transactions [Source: Story 1.5 → Previous Story Insights]
  - [ ] Modify RecentTransactions widget to show mixed manual/synced in chronological order
  - [ ] Update transaction store selectors to handle combined data sets [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
  - [ ] Ensure real-time updates when new synced transactions arrive

- [ ] Selective Editing (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create EditTransactionModal with conditional field editing based on is_synced flag
  - [ ] For synced transactions: Only allow category_id updates via PATCH /transactions/{id} [Source: architecture.md#API Specification → /transactions/{id}]
  - [ ] For synced transactions: Disable amount, description, transaction_date, type fields
  - [ ] Show clear UI indication of which fields are editable vs read-only
  - [ ] Implement category picker dropdown for synced transaction re-categorization

- [ ] Backend API Updates
  - [ ] Modify GET /transactions endpoint to include account info and sync status
  - [ ] Update PATCH /transactions/{id} to validate edit restrictions for synced transactions
  - [ ] Ensure RLS policies work correctly for mixed transaction types [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
  - [ ] Add account join queries for displaying account_name with transactions

- [ ] State Management Updates
  - [ ] Update transactionStore to handle synced transaction metadata [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
  - [ ] Create selectors for synced vs manual transaction filtering
  - [ ] Update balance calculation functions to include synced amounts

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit tests: Mixed transaction list rendering and sorting [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy → Frontend Testing]
  - [ ] Component tests: SyncedTransactionBadge display and EditTransactionModal field restrictions
  - [ ] Integration tests: Dashboard calculations with mixed transaction data
  - [ ] User interaction tests: Category editing for synced transactions only

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Requires Stories 2.1 and 2.2 completion:
- Account linking functionality (2.1) provides account_name and account_type data
- Transaction sync (2.2) populates transactions with is_synced=true and account_id associations

## Data Models
Extended transaction queries need account information: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
```typescript
// Extended transaction interface for display
export interface TransactionWithAccount extends Transaction {
  account?: {
    id: string;
    account_name: string;
    account_type: 'bank' | 'mobile_money';
  };
}
```

## API Specifications
Updated transaction endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- GET /transactions: Include JOIN with accounts table for account_name, account_type
- PATCH /transactions/{id}: Validate that synced transactions can only update category_id
- Response format should indicate which fields are editable based on is_synced status

## Component Specifications
Key UI components needed: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **SyncedTransactionBadge**: Shows bank logo/name for synced transactions
- **EditTransactionModal**: Conditional field editing based on transaction type
- **TransactionListItem**: Updated to show sync status and account info
- **CategoryPicker**: Dropdown for re-categorizing synced transactions

## File Locations
Component updates: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- Update: src/components/transactions/TransactionsList.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/TransactionListItem.tsx
- New: src/components/transactions/SyncedTransactionBadge.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/EditTransactionModal.tsx
- Update: src/components/dashboard/TotalBalanceCard.tsx (from Story 1.5)
- Update: src/components/dashboard/RecentTransactions.tsx (from Story 1.5)

Backend updates: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- Update: supabase/functions/transactions-crud/ (GET and PATCH endpoints)
- Update: RLS policies for mixed transaction access

## Security Requirements
Data access restrictions: [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- RLS ensures users only see their own transactions (manual and synced)
- Validation prevents editing of protected fields on synced transactions
- JWT authentication required for all transaction operations [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]

## State Management
Transaction store enhancements: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
// Example store additions
interface TransactionStore {
  // ... existing state
  getSyncedTransactions: () => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getManualTransactions: () => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getTotalBalance: () => number; // Updated to include synced
  getRecentMixed: (limit: number) => TransactionWithAccount[];
}
```

## UI/UX Considerations
Visual hierarchy and clarity: [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack → UI Component Library]
- Use Gluestack UI Badge component for sync indicators
- Consistent iconography for bank vs mobile money accounts
- Clear visual feedback for read-only fields in edit modal
- Maintain existing user experience for manual transaction management

## Testing Requirements
Test scenarios coverage: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Mixed transaction list display and sorting accuracy
- Category editing restrictions enforcement
- Dashboard calculation correctness with synced data
- Visual differentiation rendering
- Error handling for invalid edit attempts on synced transactions

## Technical Constraints
Performance considerations:
- Efficient JOIN queries for transaction + account data
- Pagination support for large transaction lists
- Real-time UI updates when new synced transactions arrive
- Maintain <200ms response time for transaction list queries [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
