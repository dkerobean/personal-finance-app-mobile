# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see all my bank transactions (from Mono), MTN MoMo transactions, and manual entries in one unified interface,
**so that** I have a complete view of my financial activity across all platforms.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. All transactions appear in the main "All Transactions" list: Mono bank transactions, MTN MoMo transactions, and manual entries.
2. Clear visual distinction: Bank transactions show bank logos, MTN MoMo transactions show MTN branding, manual entries show "Manual" indicator.
3. Dashboard aggregates data from both Mono bank accounts and MTN MoMo account for total balance and recent transactions.
4. Users can categorize any synced transaction but cannot edit core details (amounts, dates, descriptions are read-only for synced transactions).
5. Transaction details show the data source (Mono for banks, MTN MoMo API for mobile money) for transparency.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Requires Stories 2.1 and 2.2 completion:
- Dual account linking functionality (2.1) provides institution_name, account_name and account_type data for both Mono and MTN MoMo
- Dual platform transaction sync (2.2) populates transactions with is_synced=true and account_id associations from both Mono and MTN MoMo platforms

## Data Models
Extended transaction queries need account information: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
```typescript
// Extended transaction interface for display
export interface TransactionWithAccount extends Transaction {
  account?: {
    id: string;
    account_name: string;
    account_type: 'bank' | 'mobile_money';
    institution_name: string; // e.g., 'GCB Bank', 'Access Bank' for Mono OR 'MTN Mobile Money' for MTN MoMo
    platform_source?: 'mono' | 'mtn_momo'; // Platform identifier for transparency
  };
}
```

## API Specifications
Updated transaction endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- GET /transactions: Include JOIN with accounts table for account_name, account_type
- PATCH /transactions/{id}: Validate that synced transactions can only update category_id
- Response format should indicate which fields are editable based on is_synced status

## Component Specifications
Key UI components needed: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **InstitutionBadge**: Shows platform-specific logos/names (bank logos for Mono, MTN branding for MTN MoMo)
- **EditTransactionModal**: Conditional field editing based on transaction type and platform context
- **TransactionListItem**: Updated to show sync status, account info, and platform-specific branding
- **CategoryPicker**: Dropdown for re-categorizing synced transactions from both Mono and MTN MoMo
- **PlatformSourceIndicator**: Shows "Mono API" or "MTN MoMo API" for transaction transparency

## File Locations
Component updates: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- Update: src/components/transactions/TransactionsList.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/TransactionListItem.tsx
- New: src/components/transactions/InstitutionBadge.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/EditTransactionModal.tsx
- Update: src/components/dashboard/TotalBalanceCard.tsx (from Story 1.5)
- Update: src/components/dashboard/RecentTransactions.tsx (from Story 1.5)

Backend updates: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- Update: supabase/functions/transactions-crud/ (GET and PATCH endpoints)
- Update: RLS policies for mixed transaction access

## Security Requirements
Data access restrictions: [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- RLS ensures users only see their own transactions (manual and synced)
- Validation prevents editing of protected fields on synced transactions
- JWT authentication required for all transaction operations [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]

## State Management
Transaction store enhancements: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
// Example store additions
interface TransactionStore {
  // ... existing state
  getMonoTransactions: () => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getMTNMoMoTransactions: () => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getManualTransactions: () => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getTransactionsByPlatform: (platform: 'mono' | 'mtn_momo' | 'manual') => TransactionWithAccount[];
  getTotalBalance: () => number; // Updated to include Mono banks + MTN MoMo balance
  getRecentMixed: (limit: number) => TransactionWithAccount[];
}
```

## UI/UX Considerations
Visual hierarchy and clarity: [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack → UI Component Library]
- Use Gluestack UI Badge component for platform indicators
- Consistent iconography: Bank logos for Mono transactions, MTN branding for MTN MoMo
- Platform-specific branding colors: Bank colors for Mono, MTN brand colors for MTN MoMo
- Clear visual feedback for read-only fields in edit modal with platform context
- Platform source indicators for transparency ("Mono API" / "MTN MoMo API" labels)
- Maintain existing user experience for manual transaction management

## Testing Requirements
Test scenarios coverage: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Mixed transaction list display and sorting accuracy for Mono + MTN MoMo + manual
- Category editing restrictions enforcement for both platform types
- Dashboard calculation correctness with dual platform synced data
- Platform-specific visual differentiation rendering (bank logos vs MTN branding)
- Platform source transparency display
- Error handling for invalid edit attempts on synced transactions from both platforms

## Technical Constraints
Performance considerations:
- Efficient JOIN queries for transaction + account data
- Pagination support for large transaction lists
- Real-time UI updates when new synced transactions arrive
- Maintain <200ms response time for transaction list queries [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
