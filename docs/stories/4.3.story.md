# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Dependencies
Building on Epic 1-3 and Story 4.1 foundations:
- Requires transaction data from Epic 2 for spending analysis
- Uses budget data from Epic 3 for reallocation suggestions
- Extends Goal system from Story 4.1 with automated suggestions
- Leverages user profile and authentication from Epic 1

## Data Models
Recommendation system data structures: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database]
```typescript
export interface Recommendation {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  type: 'savings' | 'goal' | 'spending' | 'budget';
  category: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  impact_score: number; // 1-10 scale
  effort_score: number; // 1-10 scale (lower = easier)
  potential_savings: number;
  priority: number;
  action_data: Record<string, any>; // Action-specific data
  status: 'active' | 'dismissed' | 'applied' | 'expired';
  created_at: string;
  expires_at?: string;
}

export interface RecommendationSettings {
  user_id: string;
  savings_recommendations: boolean;
  goal_suggestions: boolean;
  spending_optimization: boolean;
  budget_reallocation: boolean;
  frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  sensitivity: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive';
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface UserFinancialProfile {
  user_id: string;
  monthly_income: number;
  income_stability_score: number; // 1-10
  savings_rate: number; // percentage
  financial_health_score: number; // 1-100
  spending_categories: Record<string, number>;
  last_analyzed: string;
}
```

## Recommendation Algorithm Logic
Smart recommendation generation principles:
- Income-to-savings ratio analysis for feasible savings recommendations
- Spending variance detection for optimization opportunities
- Goal timeline realism based on historical savings patterns
