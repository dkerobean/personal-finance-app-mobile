# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Depends on Epic 1 completion:
- Categories (Story 1.3) provide the spending categories for budget creation
- Authentication system (Stories 1.1-1.2) for user session and API security
- Transaction system (Story 1.4) will be used in subsequent budget tracking stories

## Data Models
Budget model from architecture: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Budgets]
```typescript
export interface Budget {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID
  category_id: string; // UUID - Links to categories from Epic 1
  amount: number; // Monthly budget limit
  month: string; // Date string like 'YYYY-MM-01' for the budget month
}
```

Category relationship for budget creation: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Categories]
- Budget creation requires existing categories from Epic 1 (Story 1.3)
- Only user's custom categories should be available for budget creation
- Categories provide display names and icons for budget visualization

## API Specifications
Budget management endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- GET /budgets: List user's budgets with category information joined
- POST /budgets: Create new budget with validation (unique constraint)
- PATCH /budgets/{id}: Update budget amount only
- DELETE /budgets/{id}: Remove budget with proper authorization
- All endpoints require JWT authentication [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]

## Component Specifications
Key UI components for budget management: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **BudgetsScreen**: Main container with list and creation actions
- **CreateBudgetModal**: Category selection, amount input, month picker
- **EditBudgetModal**: Amount editing with pre-filled values  
- **BudgetListItem**: Individual budget display with edit/delete actions
- **CategoryPicker**: Dropdown component reusable across budget flows

## File Locations
Frontend budget management: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- Screen: `app/(app)/budgets/index.tsx`
- Components: `src/components/budgets/CreateBudgetModal.tsx`, `EditBudgetModal.tsx`, `BudgetsList.tsx`
- Store: `src/stores/budgetStore.ts`
- Services: `src/services/budgetService.ts`

Backend budget system: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- Edge Functions: `supabase/functions/budgets-crud/`
- Database: Budget operations in shared repository pattern
- Migration: Budget table already defined in architecture

## Security Requirements
Budget data protection: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- JWT authentication required for all budget operations [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]
- RLS policies ensure users only access their own budgets [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- Input validation for budget amounts (positive numbers, reasonable limits)
- Prevent duplicate budgets for same category/month combination

## State Management
Budget store architecture: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
interface BudgetStore {
  budgets: Budget[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  
  // Actions
  fetchBudgets: () => Promise<void>;
  createBudget: (budget: CreateBudgetRequest) => Promise<void>;
  updateBudget: (id: string, amount: number) => Promise<void>;
  deleteBudget: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
  
  // Selectors
  getBudgetsForMonth: (month: string) => Budget[];
  getBudgetByCategory: (categoryId: string, month: string) => Budget | undefined;
}
```

## Business Logic
Budget creation constraints:
- One budget per category per month (unique constraint)
- Budget amounts must be positive numbers
- Month format standardized as 'YYYY-MM-01' [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Budgets]
- Default to current month for new budget creation
- Categories must exist and belong to the user

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive budget management testing: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Form validation testing (amount, category selection)
- CRUD operation testing with proper error handling
- Unique constraint violation testing
- Component interaction testing (modals, lists, navigation)
- RLS policy testing to ensure data isolation

## Technical Constraints
Performance and usability:
- Budget list should load quickly (<200ms for typical user) [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Proper loading states and error handling throughout
- Responsive design using Gluestack UI components [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack → UI Component Library]
