# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the app to intelligently suggest categories for my synced MTN Mobile Money transactions,
**so that** I can save time on manual organization.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. When new MTN MoMo transactions are synced, a backend process attempts to assign a category based on the transaction description (e.g., "UBER" is categorized as "Transport").
2. A basic set of categorization rules is implemented for common MTN Mobile Money transaction types.
3. MTN MoMo transactions that cannot be automatically categorized are marked as "Uncategorized".
4. The user can easily re-categorize any MTN MoMo transaction.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds on Stories 2.1-2.3:
- Integrates with transaction sync process (2.2) to categorize during import
- Enhances transaction display (2.3) to show categorization status
- Requires existing category system from Epic 1 stories (1.3)

## Data Models
Extended Transaction model with categorization metadata: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Transactions]
```typescript
export interface Transaction {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID  
  account_id: string | null; // UUID
  category_id: string; // UUID - Auto-assigned or manual
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  description: string; // Used for categorization matching
  transaction_date: string; // ISO 8601 Timestamp
  is_synced: boolean;
  auto_categorized?: boolean; // New field to track categorization source
}
```

New categorization rules structure:
```typescript
export interface CategorizationRule {
  id: string;
  category_name: string;
  keywords: string[]; // Patterns to match in description
  priority: number; // Higher priority rules checked first
}
```

## API Specifications
New/updated endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- Updated POST /accounts/{id}/sync: Include categorization in sync process
- New GET /categories/suggestions: Provide re-categorization suggestions based on similar descriptions
- Updated PATCH /transactions/{id}: Handle auto_categorized flag updates

## Component Specifications
UI components for categorization features: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **CategorySuggestionBadge**: Visual indicator for auto vs manual categorization
- **BulkCategorizeModal**: Interface for re-categorizing similar transactions
- **CategorizationFeedback**: Component for improving rule accuracy
- Updates to existing EditTransactionModal for enhanced categorization

## File Locations
Backend categorization system: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- New: supabase/functions/shared/categorization-service.ts
- New: supabase/functions/shared/categorization-rules.json
- Update: supabase/functions/accounts-sync/ (integrate categorization)
- New: supabase/migrations/add_auto_categorized_field.sql

Frontend categorization UI: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- New: src/components/transactions/CategorySuggestionBadge.tsx
- New: src/components/transactions/BulkCategorizeModal.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/EditTransactionModal.tsx
- New: src/services/categorizationService.ts

## Security Requirements
Categorization data security: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- All categorization API calls require JWT authentication [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]  
- RLS ensures users only access their categorization data [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- Input validation on transaction descriptions to prevent injection attacks [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Backend Security]

## State Management
Store updates for categorization: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
- Add categorization-related actions to transactionStore
- Create categoryStore selectors for uncategorized transaction counts
- Track categorization success metrics for analytics
- Handle real-time updates when transactions are re-categorized

## Business Logic
Categorization algorithm approach:
- Rule-based keyword matching (phase 1 - this story)
- Case-insensitive substring matching in transaction descriptions
- Priority-based rule evaluation (specific patterns before general)
- Fallback to "Uncategorized" for unmatched descriptions
- Future enhancement capability for ML-based categorization

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive categorization testing: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Rule accuracy testing with real Ghana transaction examples
- Performance testing with batch categorization operations
- UI testing for categorization status display and re-categorization flows
- Edge case handling: empty descriptions, special characters, multiple matches

## Technical Constraints
Performance and accuracy considerations:
- Categorization should not significantly slow transaction sync process
- Rule evaluation must be efficient for large transaction batches
- Support for Ghana-specific merchant names and banking terminology
- Maintain <200ms additional processing time for categorization [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
