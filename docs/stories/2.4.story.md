# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the app to intelligently suggest categories for my synced bank and mobile money transactions,
**so that** I can save time organizing transactions across all my financial accounts.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. When new transactions are synced from any connected account, a backend process attempts to assign categories based on transaction descriptions and institution-specific patterns.
2. Categorization rules are implemented for common transaction types across banks (transfers, ATM withdrawals, merchant payments) and mobile money (airtime, merchant payments, peer-to-peer transfers).
3. Transactions that cannot be automatically categorized are marked as "Uncategorized" with the source institution clearly indicated.
4. The user can easily re-categorize any transaction, and the system learns from these corrections for future categorization.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds on Stories 2.1-2.3:
- Integrates with Mono transaction sync process (2.2) to categorize during import from all institutions
- Enhances unified transaction display (2.3) to show categorization status across all account types
- Requires existing category system from Epic 1 stories (1.3)

## Data Models
Extended Transaction model with categorization metadata: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Transactions]
```typescript
export interface Transaction {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID  
  account_id: string | null; // UUID
  category_id: string; // UUID - Auto-assigned or manual
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  description: string; // Used for categorization matching
  transaction_date: string; // ISO 8601 Timestamp
  is_synced: boolean;
  auto_categorized?: boolean; // New field to track categorization source
}
```

New categorization rules structure:
```typescript
export interface CategorizationRule {
  id: string;
  category_name: string;
  keywords: string[]; // Patterns to match in description
  priority: number; // Higher priority rules checked first
}
```

## API Specifications
New/updated endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- Updated POST /accounts/{id}/sync: Include categorization in sync process
- New GET /categories/suggestions: Provide re-categorization suggestions based on similar descriptions
- Updated PATCH /transactions/{id}: Handle auto_categorized flag updates

## Component Specifications
UI components for categorization features: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **CategorySuggestionBadge**: Visual indicator for auto vs manual categorization
- **BulkCategorizeModal**: Interface for re-categorizing similar transactions
- **CategorizationFeedback**: Component for improving rule accuracy
- Updates to existing EditTransactionModal for enhanced categorization

## File Locations
Backend categorization system: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- New: supabase/functions/shared/categorization-service.ts
- New: supabase/functions/shared/categorization-rules.json
- Update: supabase/functions/accounts-sync/ (integrate categorization)
- New: supabase/migrations/add_auto_categorized_field.sql

Frontend categorization UI: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- New: src/components/transactions/CategorySuggestionBadge.tsx
- New: src/components/transactions/BulkCategorizeModal.tsx
- Update: src/components/transactions/EditTransactionModal.tsx
- New: src/services/categorizationService.ts

## Security Requirements
Categorization data security: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- All categorization API calls require JWT authentication [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]  
- RLS ensures users only access their categorization data [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- Input validation on transaction descriptions to prevent injection attacks [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Backend Security]

## State Management
Store updates for categorization: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
- Add categorization-related actions to transactionStore
- Create categoryStore selectors for uncategorized transaction counts
- Track categorization success metrics for analytics
- Handle real-time updates when transactions are re-categorized

## Business Logic
Categorization algorithm approach:
- Institution-aware rule-based keyword matching (phase 1 - this story)
- Case-insensitive substring matching in transaction descriptions with institution context
- Priority-based rule evaluation (institution-specific patterns before general)
- Institution-specific fallback patterns before "Uncategorized"
- Support for bank transaction codes and mobile money transaction types
- Future enhancement capability for ML-based categorization across all institutions

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive categorization testing: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Rule accuracy testing with real Ghana transaction examples
- Performance testing with batch categorization operations
- UI testing for categorization status display and re-categorization flows
- Edge case handling: empty descriptions, special characters, multiple matches

## Technical Constraints
Performance and accuracy considerations:
- Categorization should not significantly slow transaction sync process
- Rule evaluation must be efficient for large transaction batches
- Support for Ghana-specific merchant names, banking terminology, and mobile money patterns
- Handle institution-specific transaction formats from Mono API
- Maintain <200ms additional processing time for categorization across all account types [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
