# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Integrates with entire app ecosystem:
- Uses transaction data from Epic 1 (Stories 1.4, 1.5) and potentially Epic 2 synced transactions
- Can incorporate budget data from Stories 3.1-3.2 for budget vs actual comparisons
- Leverages category system from Epic 1 (Story 1.3) for breakdown visualization

## Data Models
Report data structure for API responses:
```typescript
export interface MonthlyReport {
  month: string; // 'YYYY-MM' format
  totalIncome: number;
  totalExpenses: number;
  netIncome: number; // totalIncome - totalExpenses
  transactionCount: number;
  categoryBreakdown: CategorySpending[];
}

export interface CategorySpending {
  categoryId: string;
  categoryName: string;
  categoryIcon: string;
  totalAmount: number;
  percentage: number; // percentage of total expenses
  transactionCount: number;
}
```

Transaction aggregation requirements: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Transactions]
- Filter by transaction_date within month boundaries
- Group by category_id and type (income/expense)
- Sum amounts for each category
- Include both manual (is_synced=false) and synced (is_synced=true) transactions

## API Specifications
Monthly report endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- GET /reports/monthly/{month}: Returns complete monthly report data
- GET /reports/summary: Returns last 12 months summary for trend analysis
- Query parameters: include_budgets (boolean) to add budget comparison data
- Response includes aggregated data, category breakdowns, and metadata

## Component Specifications
Report visualization components: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **ReportsScreen**: Main container with month selection and report display
- **MonthPicker**: Month selection interface with last 12 months
- **MonthlySummaryCard**: Income/expense totals with net income calculation
- **CategoryBreakdownChart**: Pie chart or bar chart for expense categories
- **ReportMetrics**: Additional metrics (avg transaction, category counts)

## File Locations
Frontend reports implementation: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- Screen: `app/(app)/reports/index.tsx`
- Components: `src/components/reports/ReportsScreen.tsx`, `MonthlySummaryCard.tsx`, `CategoryBreakdownChart.tsx`
- Store: `src/stores/reportsStore.ts`
- Services: `src/services/reportsService.ts`

Backend reports system: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- Edge Functions: `supabase/functions/reports/`
- Shared: Report aggregation utilities in shared services
- Integration with existing transaction and category services

## Security Requirements
Report data access control: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- JWT authentication required for all report endpoints [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]
- RLS policies ensure users only access their own transaction data [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- Validate date ranges to prevent excessive historical data requests
- Sanitize and validate all report parameters

## State Management
Reports store architecture: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
interface ReportsStore {
  currentReport: MonthlyReport | null;
  selectedMonth: string; // 'YYYY-MM' format
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  
  // Actions
  fetchMonthlyReport: (month: string) => Promise<void>;
  setSelectedMonth: (month: string) => void;
  refreshReport: () => Promise<void>;
  
  // Selectors
  getCurrentMonthReport: () => MonthlyReport | null;
  getCategoryBreakdown: () => CategorySpending[];
}
```

## Business Logic
Report calculation logic:
- Month boundaries: Use first and last day of selected month for filtering
- Currency precision: Handle decimal calculations accurately
- Category grouping: Group uncategorized transactions appropriately
- Percentage calculations: (categoryAmount / totalExpenses) * 100
- Handle zero divisions and empty data gracefully

## Performance Considerations
Report generation optimization: [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
- Database indexes on transaction_date and category_id for fast aggregation
- Cache frequently accessed report data (current month, previous month)
- Lazy loading for chart components to improve initial screen load
- Pagination for detailed transaction lists within categories
- Efficient memory usage for large datasets

## Visualization Requirements
Chart implementation considerations:
- Choose lightweight charting library compatible with React Native
- Support for pie charts, bar charts, and potentially line charts for trends
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Accessibility support for chart data (screen readers, alternative text)
- Color schemes that work with app theme and are colorblind-friendly

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive reporting system testing: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Data accuracy: Verify report calculations match raw transaction data
- Chart rendering: Test visualization components with various data sets
- Month selection: Test boundary conditions and date handling
- Performance testing: Large transaction datasets and report generation speed
- Edge cases: Empty months, single category, very large amounts

## Technical Constraints
Reporting system requirements:
- Must handle different currencies and decimal precision appropriately
- Support for different date formats and localization
- Maintain performance with growing transaction history
- Charts must be accessible and work across iOS and Android
- Report data should be exportable for future enhancements
