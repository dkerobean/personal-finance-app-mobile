# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to securely connect my bank accounts via Mono and my MTN Mobile Money account through direct MTN MoMo integration,
**so that** all my financial transactions can be automatically tracked with the best platform for each account type.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. An "Add Account" option is available with choices: "Link Bank Account" and "Link MTN MoMo Account".
2. For bank accounts: Launches Mono Connect Widget showing available Ghanaian banks with Mono's authentication flow.
3. For MTN MoMo: Custom integration using MTN MoMo Collections API with phone number verification and PIN authentication.
4. Upon successful bank authentication, the app receives and securely stores the Mono Account ID.
5. Upon successful MTN MoMo authentication, the app stores MTN reference ID and phone number securely.
6. All linked accounts appear in "Linked Accounts" with appropriate branding (bank logos vs MTN MoMo logo) and account types.
7. Users can unlink any connected account through the appropriate platform's unlinking process.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in previous stories - this is the first hybrid integration story combining Mono API for banks and MTN MoMo API for mobile money.

## Data Models
Account model structure from architecture: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Accounts]
```typescript
export interface Account {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID
  account_name: string;
  account_type: 'bank' | 'mobile_money';
  institution_name: string; // e.g., 'GCB Bank', 'Access Bank' OR 'MTN Mobile Money'
  balance: number;
  // Platform-specific identifiers (only one will be populated)
  mono_account_id?: string; // For bank accounts via Mono
  mtn_reference_id?: string; // For MTN MoMo accounts
  mtn_phone_number?: string; // MTN MoMo phone number
  last_synced_at: string; // ISO 8601 Timestamp
}
```

## API Specifications
- POST /accounts/link endpoint for linking new accounts [Source: architecture.md#API Specification → /accounts/link]
- All endpoints require valid JWT from Supabase Auth [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- Backend API hosted at: https://{your-supabase-project-ref}.supabase.co/functions/v1 [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]

## External API Integration

**Mono API (Banks):**

- Key flow: Widget → Code → Account ID exchange

**MTN MoMo API (Mobile Money):**
- Documentation: https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/
- Authentication: Subscription Keys → API User → API Key → Access Token
- Environment variables: MTN_MOMO_PRIMARY_KEY, MTN_MOMO_SECONDARY_KEY
