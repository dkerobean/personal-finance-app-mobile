# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Dependencies
Building on Story 4.1 and 4.2 foundations:
- Requires goal completion detection from Story 4.2 progress tracking
- Uses milestone data from Story 4.2 contribution system
- Leverages existing goal data models from Story 4.1
- Integrates with notification system established in previous epics

## Data Models
Achievement and celebration data structures: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database]
```typescript
export interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  type: 'goal_completion' | 'milestone' | 'badge' | 'streak' | 'special';
  reference_id?: string; // goal_id, badge_id, etc.
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon_name: string;
  value?: number; // amount saved, days in streak, etc.
  achieved_at: string;
  celebrated: boolean;
  shared: boolean;
  celebration_data?: Record<string, any>;
}

export interface Badge {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon_name: string;
  category: 'savings' | 'goals' | 'consistency' | 'special';
  criteria: BadgeCriteria;
  rarity: 'common' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
  is_active: boolean;
}

export interface UserBadge {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  badge_id: string;
  earned_at: string;
  progress?: number; // for progressive badges
  is_completed: boolean;
}

export interface CelebrationSettings {
  user_id: string;
  enable_animations: boolean;
  enable_sounds: boolean;
  enable_haptics: boolean;
  enable_notifications: boolean;
  celebration_intensity: 'minimal' | 'moderate' | 'full';
  privacy_level: 'private' | 'friends' | 'public';
  auto_share: boolean;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

## Badge System Design

## Celebration Animation System
Achievement celebration mechanics:
```typescript
interface CelebrationSystem {
  // Animation Types
  confettiCelebration: (intensity: 'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy') => void;
  trophyCelebration: (achievement: Achievement) => void;
  badgeUnlockCelebration: (badge: Badge) => void;
  
  // Celebration Triggers
  triggerMilestoneCelebration: (milestone: number, goal: Goal) => void;
  triggerGoalCompletion: (goal: Goal) => void;
  triggerBadgeEarned: (badge: Badge) => void;
  
  // Customization
  applyCelebrationSettings: (settings: CelebrationSettings) => void;
}
```

## State Management Architecture
Achievement store design: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#State Management]
```typescript
interface AchievementStore {
  achievements: Achievement[];
  badges: Badge[];
  userBadges: UserBadge[];
  settings: CelebrationSettings;
  stats: AchievementStats;
  loading: boolean;
  
  // Actions
  loadAchievements: () => Promise<void>;
  loadBadges: () => Promise<void>;
  triggerCelebration: (achievement: Achievement) => Promise<void>;
  shareAchievement: (achievement: Achievement, platform: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  updateSettings: (settings: Partial<CelebrationSettings>) => Promise<void>;
  
  // Selectors
  getRecentAchievements: (days: number) => Achievement[];
  getEarnedBadges: () => UserBadge[];
  getAvailableBadges: () => Badge[];
  getCelebrationQueue: () => Achievement[];
  getJourneyMilestones: () => Achievement[];
}
```

## Social Sharing Implementation
Platform-specific sharing features:
- **Instagram Stories**: Custom achievement graphics with branding
- **WhatsApp**: Personal achievement messages with privacy controls
- **Twitter**: Achievement tweets with hashtags and progress metrics
- **Facebook**: Achievement posts with customizable privacy settings
- **In-App Sharing**: Friend connections and achievement feed
- **Anonymous Sharing**: Community achievement sharing without personal info

## Badge Evaluation Engine
Automated badge detection and awarding:
```typescript
interface BadgeEvaluationEngine {
  // Evaluation Methods
  evaluateGoalBadges: (user: User, goals: Goal[]) => Badge[];
  evaluateSavingsBadges: (user: User, contributions: Contribution[]) => Badge[];
  evaluateConsistencyBadges: (user: User, activity: ActivityLog[]) => Badge[];
  
  // Progress Tracking
  updateBadgeProgress: (userId: string, badgeId: string, progress: number) => void;
  checkBadgeCompletion: (userId: string) => Badge[];
  
  // Special Events
  evaluateSeasonalBadges: (user: User, season: Season) => Badge[];
  evaluateSpecialEventBadges: (user: User, event: SpecialEvent) => Badge[];
}
```

## Privacy and Sharing Controls
User privacy protection in achievement sharing:
- Granular privacy controls for different achievement types
- Anonymous sharing options with personal data removed
- Friend-only sharing within app ecosystem  
- Opt-out capability for all social features
- Data retention controls for shared achievements
- GDPR compliance for European users

## Performance Considerations
Achievement system optimization: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance]
- Cached badge evaluation to prevent repeated calculations
- Background celebration preparation for smooth animations
- Lazy loading of achievement history and images
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Optimized animation performance with React Native Reanimated
- Social sharing image generation optimization

## Gamification Psychology
Motivation-driven achievement design:
- **Progress Recognition**: Celebrate small wins to maintain motivation
- **Social Validation**: Enable sharing for external motivation
- **Surprise and Delight**: Unexpected badges for exceptional behavior
- **Personal Growth**: Achievement progression showing financial maturity
- **Community Connection**: Anonymous leaderboards and comparisons
- **Habit Formation**: Consistency rewards to build saving habits
