# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to easily see how much I've spent compared to my budget for each category,
**so that** I know if I'm staying on track.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. The "Budgets" screen displays each budget along with the total amount spent in that category for the current month.
2. A clear visual indicator, such as a progress bar, shows what percentage of the budget has been used.
3. The display updates automatically when new transactions are added or categorized.
4. Tapping a budget item navigates to a filtered list of all transactions in that category for the current month.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds directly on Story 3.1:
- Requires existing budget creation and management functionality
- Integrates with Epic 1 transaction system (Story 1.4) for spending calculations
- If Epic 2 implemented, must include synced transactions in calculations

## Data Models
Extended budget interface with spending data: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Budgets]
```typescript
export interface BudgetWithSpending extends Budget {
  spent: number; // Total spent in category for the month
  percentage: number; // (spent / amount) * 100
  remaining: number; // amount - spent
  status: 'on_track' | 'warning' | 'over_budget';
  transaction_count: number; // Number of transactions in category/month
}
```

Transaction aggregation for spending calculation: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Transactions]
- Filter by category_id and transaction_date within budget month
- Sum amounts where type='expense' for the category
- Include both manual (is_synced=false) and automated transactions (is_synced=true) if applicable

## API Specifications
Enhanced budget endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- GET /budgets/tracking: Returns budgets with spending calculations for current month
- GET /budgets/{id}/transactions: Returns filtered transactions for budget detail view
- Query parameters: month (YYYY-MM format) for historical budget tracking
- Response includes aggregated spending data and transaction counts

## Component Specifications
Budget tracking UI components: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **BudgetProgressCard**: Visual budget progress with bar, percentages, and status colors
- **BudgetDetailScreen**: Full-screen view of budget with transaction list
- **BudgetStatusBadge**: Color-coded status indicator (on track/warning/over budget)
- **SpendingChart**: Optional visual spending breakdown (pie chart or bar chart)

## File Locations
Budget tracking implementation: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Frontend Repository]
- Update: `app/(app)/budgets/index.tsx` (main budgets screen)
- New: `app/(app)/budgets/[id]/transactions.tsx` (budget detail/transactions)
- New: `src/components/budgets/BudgetProgressCard.tsx`
- New: `src/components/budgets/BudgetDetailScreen.tsx`
- Update: `src/stores/budgetStore.ts` (add tracking capabilities)
- New: `src/services/budgetTrackingService.ts`

Backend tracking services: [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure → Backend Repository]
- New: `supabase/functions/budget-tracking/`
- Update: Budgeting Service to include spending calculations [Source: architecture.md#Components → Budgeting Service]

## Security Requirements
Budget tracking data access: [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements]
- All budget tracking data protected by RLS policies [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]
- JWT authentication required for all tracking endpoints [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Authentication Security]
- Validate user owns budgets and transactions before aggregation
- Prevent data leakage between users in aggregated queries

## State Management
Enhanced budget store for tracking: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → State Management Architecture]
```typescript
interface BudgetTrackingStore extends BudgetStore {
  // Tracking-specific state
  budgetsWithSpending: BudgetWithSpending[];
  lastUpdated: string;
  
  // Tracking actions
  fetchBudgetTracking: (month?: string) => Promise<void>;
  refreshBudgetSpending: () => Promise<void>;
  getBudgetProgress: (budgetId: string) => BudgetWithSpending | undefined;
  
  // Real-time update handlers
  onTransactionChanged: (transaction: Transaction) => void;
}
```

## Business Logic
Budget tracking calculations:
- Spending percentage: (totalSpent / budgetAmount) * 100
- Status determination: <75% = on_track, 75-90% = warning, >90% = over_budget
- Remaining budget: budgetAmount - totalSpent (can be negative)
- Month filtering: Use transaction_date within budget month boundaries
- Currency precision: Handle decimal calculations appropriately

## Performance Considerations
Optimization strategies: [Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance → Performance Optimization]
- Cache aggregated spending calculations
- Use database indexes on category_id and transaction_date
- Implement pagination for large transaction lists in detail view
- Debounce real-time updates to avoid excessive API calls
- Pre-calculate common aggregations (monthly totals, category sums)

## Testing Requirements
Comprehensive tracking validation: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Accuracy testing: Verify spending calculations match transaction sums
- Real-time update testing: Ensure UI updates when transactions change
- Edge case testing: Zero budgets, over-budget scenarios, no transactions
- Performance testing: Large transaction datasets, concurrent updates
- Visual testing: Progress bar accuracy, color coding correctness

## Technical Constraints
User experience and performance:
- Real-time updates should be smooth and performant
- Progress calculations must be accurate to prevent user confusion  
- Visual indicators should be intuitive and accessible
- Support for different currency formats and decimal precision
- Maintain responsive design across different screen sizes
