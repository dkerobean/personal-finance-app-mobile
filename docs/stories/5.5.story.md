# Story 5.5: Net Worth Dashboard Screen

**Epic**: 5 - Personal Net Worth Calculator  
**Story**: 5.5  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Estimated Effort**: 6 days (Completed in 3 days - many components were already implemented)  
**Dependencies**: Story 5.4 (Calculation Engine), Story 5.2 (Assets), Story 5.3 (Liabilities)

## Story Statement

**As a** user  
**I want** a dedicated screen showing my current net worth and breakdown  
**So that** I can quickly understand my overall financial position

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Main Net Worth Display**

   - Percentage change from previous month with trend indicator
   - Loading state while calculating
   - Error state with retry option

2. **Assets vs Liabilities Breakdown**
   - Total assets amount with breakdown card
   - Total liabilities amount with breakdown card
   - Visual representation (progress bars or simple charts)
   - Category-wise breakdown for both assets and liabilities
   - Connected vs manual breakdown
   - Tap-to-expand for detailed category view

3. **Quick Action Buttons**
   - "Add Asset" button leading to asset creation screen
   - "Add Liability" button leading to liability creation screen
   - "View Assets" button leading to assets list
   - "View Liabilities" button leading to liabilities list
   - "View History" button for historical tracking (Story 5.6)

4. **Simple Trend Visualization**

   - Proper navigation integration with tab/drawer navigation
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Accessibility support (screen readers, proper contrast)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Screen Location and Navigation** [Source: app/(app)/ structure]:
- Main screen: `app/(app)/networth/index.tsx`
- Integration with main app navigation
- Tab navigation or drawer menu integration
- Proper route metadata and titles

**UI Component Architecture** [Source: existing dashboard patterns]:
- Follow pattern from main dashboard (`app/(app)/index.tsx`)
- Reuse existing card components and layout patterns
- Consistent with dashboard component architecture
- Use existing loading and error state components

**Design System Integration** [Source: src/constants/design.ts and existing components]:
- Use COLORS, SPACING, TYPOGRAPHY, SHADOWS constants
- Follow existing card and button design patterns
- Consistent with app's visual hierarchy
- Use existing icon set (MaterialIcons)

### Component Structure and Layout

**Main Dashboard Component** (`app/(app)/networth/index.tsx`):
Following pattern from main dashboard:
```tsx
// Key sections:
- Header with navigation and title
- Net Worth Summary Card (main display)
- Assets vs Liabilities Cards
- Quick Actions Grid
- Trend Visualization Component
- Pull-to-refresh wrapper
```

**Component Breakdown**:
```tsx
// New components needed:
- NetWorthSummaryCard (main net worth display)
- AssetsLiabilitiesBreakdown (breakdown visualization)
- NetWorthTrendChart (simple trend visualization)
- QuickActionsGrid (action buttons)
- NetWorthLoadingState (loading skeleton)
- NetWorthErrorState (error display with retry)
```

### Data Integration and State Management

**Store Integration** [Source: netWorthStore patterns]:
```typescript
// Key store selectors:
- currentNetWorth: NetWorthCalculation | null
- isCalculating: boolean
- calculationError: string | null
- historicalData: NetWorthSnapshot[]
- assetsBreakdown: AssetBreakdown[]
- liabilitiesBreakdown: LiabilityBreakdown[]

// Key store actions:
- refreshNetWorth(): Promise<void>
- loadHistoricalData(): Promise<void>
- resetCalculationError(): void
```

**Real-time Updates**:
- Subscribe to asset/liability changes
- Automatic recalculation triggers
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background refresh capabilities

### Visual Design and UX

**Net Worth Display Design**:
Following existing card patterns from dashboard:
```tsx
// Main net worth card:
- Large, prominent value display
- Color coding: Green (positive), Red (negative), Gray (zero)
- Percentage change badge with arrow indicators
- Subtle background gradients or patterns
- Loading skeleton matching card structure
```

**Breakdown Visualization**:
```tsx
// Assets vs Liabilities cards:
- Side-by-side layout on larger screens
- Stacked layout on mobile
- Category breakdown with icons and percentages
- Progress bars or simple donut charts
- Expandable sections for detailed breakdown
```

**Chart Integration** [Source: existing chart patterns]:
- Simple line chart for trend visualization
- Consistent with existing chart styling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Loading and empty states
- Data point selection and tooltips

### Quick Actions Design

**Action Button Grid**:
Following existing action button patterns:
```tsx
// 2x2 grid layout:
Row 1: [Add Asset] [Add Liability]
Row 2: [View Assets] [View Liabilities]
Bottom: [View History] (full width)

// Design consistency:
- Same styling as dashboard action buttons
- Consistent icons and colors
- Proper spacing and touch targets
- Loading states during navigation
```

### Performance Considerations

**Data Loading Strategy**:
- Progressive loading (net worth first, then details)
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Background updates without blocking UI
- Efficient re-rendering with React optimization

**Chart Performance**:
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Data aggregation for better performance
- Smooth animations without blocking main thread
- Memory management for large datasets

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Error States**:
- Network connection errors
- Calculation service failures
- Insufficient data scenarios
- Stale data warnings

**Edge Cases**:
- Zero net worth display
- Negative net worth visualization
- No assets or liabilities scenario
- First-time user experience

### Accessibility and Usability

**Accessibility Features** [Source: existing accessibility patterns]:
- Proper semantic markup
- Screen reader support for financial values
- High contrast mode support
- Touch target size compliance
- Keyboard navigation support

**Usability Enhancements**:
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent information architecture
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Context-sensitive help or tooltips
