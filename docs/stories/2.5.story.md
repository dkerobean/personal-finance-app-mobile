# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** both my bank accounts (via Mono) and MTN MoMo account to be updated automatically in the background,
**so that** my complete financial data from both platforms is always current without manual effort.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Scheduled backend tasks run periodically for both platforms: Mono Real-time Data API for bank accounts and MTN MoMo API for mobile money transactions.
2. Platform-specific duplicate prevention: Use Mono's transaction IDs for banks and MTN MoMo reference IDs for mobile money transactions.
3. Independent error handling for each platform with appropriate retry mechanisms and user notifications.
4. Re-authentication handled per platform: Mono's re-auth flow for bank accounts and MTN MoMo API user/key regeneration for mobile money.
5. Background sync status available in app settings showing last sync times and status for each connected account type.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds on entire Epic 2 dual platform foundation:
- Dual account linking (2.1) provides linked accounts from both Mono and MTN MoMo to sync
- Dual platform transaction sync (2.2) provides core sync logic for both platforms to make periodic
- Unified transaction display (2.3) shows results of background sync from both platforms
- Dual platform categorization (2.4) applies to new background-synced transactions from both platforms

## Data Models
Extended Account model with sync metadata: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Accounts]
```typescript
export interface Account {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID
  account_name: string;
  account_type: 'bank' | 'mobile_money';
  balance: number;
  // Platform-specific identifiers
  mono_account_id?: string; // For bank accounts via Mono
  mtn_reference_id?: string; // For MTN MoMo accounts
  last_synced_at: string; // ISO 8601 - Updated by background sync
  sync_status?: 'active' | 'auth_required' | 'error'; // New field
  last_sync_attempt?: string; // ISO 8601 - Track attempts vs success
  platform_source?: 'mono' | 'mtn_momo'; // Platform identifier
}
```

New sync tracking model:
```typescript
export interface SyncLog {
  id: string;
  account_id: string;
  platform_source: 'mono' | 'mtn_momo'; // Platform that performed the sync
  sync_started_at: string;
  sync_completed_at?: string;
  transactions_synced: number;
  status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'auth_error';
  error_message?: string;
  platform_specific_error?: string; // Mono API error vs MTN MoMo API error
}
```
