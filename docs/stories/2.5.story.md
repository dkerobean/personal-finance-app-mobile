# Story

**As a** user,
**I want** my MTN Mobile Money account to be updated automatically in the background,
**so that** my mobile money data is always up-to-date without manual effort.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. A scheduled backend task runs periodically (e.g., daily) to fetch new transactions for the linked MTN MoMo account.
2. Only new MTN MoMo transactions that have not been previously synced are added to the database.
3. The background sync is efficient and handles errors without impacting the user experience.
4. (Optional for MVP) The user receives a notification if the linked MTN MoMo account requires re-authentication.

# Dev Notes

## Previous Story Insights
Builds on entire Epic 2 foundation:
- Account linking (2.1) provides linked accounts to sync
- Transaction sync (2.2) provides core sync logic to make periodic
- Transaction display (2.3) shows results of background sync
- Categorization (2.4) applies to new background-synced transactions

## Data Models
Extended Account model with sync metadata: [Source: architecture.md#Data Models → Accounts]
```typescript
export interface Account {
  id: string; // UUID
  user_id: string; // UUID
  account_name: string;
  account_type: 'bank' | 'mobile_money';
  balance: number;
  aggregator_account_id: string;
  last_synced_at: string; // ISO 8601 - Updated by background sync
  sync_status?: 'active' | 'auth_required' | 'error'; // New field
  last_sync_attempt?: string; // ISO 8601 - Track attempts vs success
}
```

New sync tracking model:
```typescript
export interface SyncLog {
  id: string;
  account_id: string;
  sync_started_at: string;
  sync_completed_at?: string;
  transactions_synced: number;
  status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'auth_error';
  error_message?: string;
}
```

## API Specifications
Background sync endpoints: [Source: architecture.md#API Specification]
- Internal: POST /sync/background - Triggered by scheduler
- Internal: POST /sync/account/{id} - Manual sync specific account  
- GET /accounts - Include sync_status and last_synced_at in response
- All endpoints authenticated via service account for background operations

## External API Integration
Enhanced MTN Mobile Money API usage:
- Implement rate limit handling (respect API limits)
- Use incremental date ranges for efficiency
- Handle authentication token refresh/expiry scenarios
- Batch API calls efficiently for multiple accounts

OneSignal integration: [Source: architecture.md#External APIs → OneSignal API]
- Documentation: https://documentation.onesignal.com/
- Backend uses App ID and REST API Key
- POST /notifications endpoint for re-auth alerts
- User segmentation for targeted notifications

## Component Specifications
Sync status UI components: [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture → Component Architecture]
- **SyncStatusIndicator**: Shows last sync time and status in account list
- **ManualSyncButton**: Triggers immediate sync for specific account
- **SyncNotificationHandler**: Processes and displays sync-related notifications
- **AccountSyncSettings**: User preferences for sync frequency and notifications

- Secure handling of sensitive account data during sync
- Rate limiting protection to prevent API abuse [Source: architecture.md#Security Requirements → Backend Security]
- RLS ensures sync results only accessible to account owners [Source: architecture.md#Backend Architecture → Authentication and Authorization]

## State Management

- Update transaction store when background sync adds new transactions
- Handle real-time UI updates for sync status changes
- Manage sync-triggered notification state

## Infrastructure Considerations
Scheduler and monitoring: [Source: architecture.md#Deployment Architecture]
- Use Supabase cron or external scheduler (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Monitor sync job health and performance
- Handle timezone considerations for daily sync timing
- Scale sync frequency based on user account activity patterns

## Testing Requirements

- Scheduled job execution testing (mocked scheduler)
- Deduplication accuracy with overlapping sync windows
- Error recovery and retry mechanism testing
- Performance testing with large numbers of accounts and transactions
- Notification delivery and deep-linking testing

## Technical Constraints
Performance and reliability requirements:
- Background sync should not impact user-facing API performance
- Handle concurrent user and background sync operations safely
