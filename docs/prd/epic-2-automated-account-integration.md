# Epic 2: MTN Mobile Money Integration

**Expanded Goal:** The goal of this epic is to deliver the app's primary value proposition: automation through MTN Mobile Money integration. We will build the functionality to securely link MTN Mobile Money accounts using the official MTN MoMo API. This will eliminate the need for manual data entry for mobile money transactions, providing users with a real-time, hands-off overview of their mobile money financial activity. Bank account integration will be added in a future release.

### Story 2.1: Secure MTN MoMo Account Linking
**As a** user,
**I want** to securely connect my MTN Mobile Money account to the app,
**so that** my mobile money transactions can be automatically tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  An "Add MTN MoMo Account" option is available within the app.
2.  Tapping this option launches the official MTN Mobile Money API authentication flow.
3.  The user can successfully authenticate with their MTN Mobile Money account via the official MTN MoMo authentication process.
4.  Upon a successful link, the app securely stores the necessary token to access the MTN MoMo account's data.
5.  The newly linked MTN MoMo account appears in a list of "Linked Accounts" in the app's settings.
6.  The user has the ability to unlink their MTN MoMo account.

### Story 2.2: Initial MTN MoMo Transaction Sync
**As a** user,
**I want** the app to import my recent MTN Mobile Money transaction history after I link my account,
**so that** I have an immediate and useful overview of my mobile money spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Immediately after an MTN MoMo account is successfully linked, the app automatically fetches the last 30 days of mobile money transactions.
2.  Fetched transactions are stored securely in the database and associated with the correct user and MTN MoMo account.
3.  The sync process displays clear feedback to the user (e.g., a loading indicator followed by a success message).
4.  The process gracefully handles and reports any API errors during the sync.

### Story 2.3: Displaying Synced MTN MoMo Transactions
**As a** user,
**I want** to see my automatically synced MTN Mobile Money transactions alongside my manual entries,
**so that** I have a single, unified view of my finances.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Synced MTN MoMo transactions appear in the main "All Transactions" list.
2.  Synced transactions are clearly identifiable from manual entries (e.g., via an MTN MoMo logo).
3.  The dashboard's "Total Balance" and "Recent Transactions" widgets are updated to include data from the synced MTN MoMo account.
4.  Users can change the category of a synced MTN MoMo transaction but cannot edit the amount, date, or description.

### Story 2.4: Basic Automated Categorization for MTN MoMo
**As a** user,
**I want** the app to intelligently suggest categories for my synced MTN Mobile Money transactions,
**so that** I can save time on manual organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When new MTN MoMo transactions are synced, a backend process attempts to assign a category based on the transaction description (e.g., "UBER" is categorized as "Transport").
2.  A basic set of categorization rules is implemented for common MTN Mobile Money transaction types.
3.  MTN MoMo transactions that cannot be automatically categorized are marked as "Uncategorized".
4.  The user can easily re-categorize any MTN MoMo transaction.

### Story 2.5: Background MTN MoMo Synchronization

**I want** my MTN Mobile Money account to be updated automatically in the background,
**so that** my mobile money data is always up-to-date without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A scheduled backend task runs periodically (e.g., daily) to fetch new transactions for the linked MTN MoMo account.
2.  Only new MTN MoMo transactions that have not been previously synced are added to the database.
3.  The background sync is efficient and handles errors without impacting the user experience.
4.  (Optional for MVP) The user receives a notification if the linked MTN MoMo account requires re-authentication.
