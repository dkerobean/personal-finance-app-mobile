# Checklist Results Report
As the Product Manager, I have executed the **PM Master Checklist** against this PRD. The document has **passed** the validation check. The requirements are internally consistent, the MVP scope is clearly defined and aligned with the project's goals, and the epics are logically sequenced for incremental value delivery. The PRD is now ready for the architecture and design phase.
