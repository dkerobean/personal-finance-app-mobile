# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Provide users with a single, clear, and consolidated view of their complete financial health.
* Automate the process of tracking income and expenses by integrating with local Ghanaian banks and Mobile Money services.
* Empower users with AI-powered insights to make informed financial decisions.
* Create a secure, scalable, and low-cost application suitable for a personal project with the potential for future growth.

## Background Context
The project aims to solve the problem of financial fragmentation for tech-savvy individuals in Ghana. Users currently struggle to manage their money across multiple disconnected platforms (bank apps, MoMo, spreadsheets), leading to a lack of visibility and ineffective planning. This app will provide a hyper-local, all-in-one solution that goes beyond simple data aggregation by offering intelligent, actionable insights.
